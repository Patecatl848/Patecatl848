I have seen a lot of technology change throughout the years and I want to be part of those changes. I will be working on creating an App to implement a more verbose and automated framework to build Pythonic scripts to a Mechanization that incorporates Algorithms, Pandas, ML & Seaborn. I feel that this will be an excellent project for me to work on, I would love to provide more data as time goes by and my skills are well established to web scrape the particular site that offers so much data. More To Come 👨🏻‍💻🧪👀🧠🦾🐍 ヽ(゜▽゜　)－C<(/;◇;)/~ ...
