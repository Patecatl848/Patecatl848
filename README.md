I have seen a lot of technology change throughout the years and I want to be part of that train. I will be working on creating an App for monitoring the health of post-operation patients with Cardiac Surgery. I feel that this will be an excellent project for me to work on, I would love to provide more data as time goes by and my skills are well established to web scrape the particular site that offers so much data. More To Come 👨🏻‍💻🧪👀🧠🦾🐍 ヽ(゜▽゜　)－C<(/;◇;)/~ ...
